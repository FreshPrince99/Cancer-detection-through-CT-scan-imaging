# Cancer-detection-through-CT-scan-imaging
This project uses deep learning and computer vision to predict cancerous CT scan images among the normal ones. Using the datasets provided by Kaggle we have developed different architectures. This current project uses Decision Trees to come up with an accurate model.\n
